# Digital Image Processing Exercises

This project was developed as part of the course **"Digital Image Processing"**, part of the 2024â€“25 syllabus for the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

Each directory corresponds to an individual exercise and can be executed independently by running the respective `demo.py` files.
